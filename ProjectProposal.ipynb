The dataset contains 2 CSV files, ‘train.csv’ and ‘test.csv’. They contain all data fields such as house style, neighborhood, and corresponding house prices. \n",

Certainly, we don’t want to reveal information that might disturb the privacy of the owner. So after careful consideration, we have decided to comply with the Safe Harbor Method and anonymized our data. Besides this,  the dataset is pretty neutral without potential biases, and not a certain population are excluded.  Since most of the features in the dataset are tightly related to the house itself (such as house style, roof style, year built), more issues related to data privacy and ethics are unlikely to show up.\n"

The major contribution of this project is our model will show users several factors they will need to consider before they look for a house. \n",
    "On the other hand, there are possibly still many more factors that could affect the housing price, but we are not able to consider them all. Besides, there are potential pitfalls of our data: first, the dataset only contains 2919 variables. As a result, we don’t have enough instances of house for our analysis. Second, the dataset doesn’t scale outside the city of Ames, Iowa. As a result, we restrict our analysis and may subject to bias. In conclusion, although the dataset provide buyer some insight about the housing price, it is still far from enough to find a full-fledged housing formula for house buyers.\n"
